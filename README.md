# pesel-wum
Android application made with java and android studio. It calculates age based on part of polish personal identity number called "pesel". Created to make filling in documents easier for my friends and to learn something about creating apps

Text in app is in polish only.

It is first android application i've ever made. It was fun trying out something new and the appi is pretty helpful for my friends :)
