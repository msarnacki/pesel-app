PESEL is a polish personality identity number. It always has 11 digits, identifies just one person and cannot be changed to another one. First 6 digits are YYMMDD and it is the date of birth (with century encoded in month field - if born in 21st century month is number from 20 to 32 [MM = realMM + 20])

It is android application made with java and android studio. It calculates age of person when first 6 digits of PESEL are given. Created to make filling in documents easier for my friends and to learn something about creating mobile apps.

Text in app is in polish only but it is so easy to use. You can download it from [here]("../apk"). To calculate the age put in first 6 digits of PESEL in text box and press button. 

It is first android application i've ever made. It was fun trying out something new and the app is pretty helpful for my friends :)
